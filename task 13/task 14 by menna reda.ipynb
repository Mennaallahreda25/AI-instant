    "2-One sample median test\n",
    "A one sample median test allows us to test whether a sample median differs significantly from a hypothesized value.  We will use the same variable, write, but we do not need to assume that it is interval and normally distributed (we only need to assume that write is an ordinal variable).\n",

    "5-Two independent samples t-test\n",
    "An independent samples t-test is used when you want to compare the means of a normally distributed interval dependent variable for two independent groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "6-Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test\n",
    "The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test is a non-parametric analog to the independent samples t-test and can be used when you do not assume that the dependent variable is a normally distributed interval variable (you only assume that the variable is at least ordinal).  You will notice that the SPSS syntax for the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test is almost identical to that of the independent samples t-test.  We will use the same data file (the hsb2 data file) and the same variables in this example as we did in the independent t-test example above and will not assume that write, our dependent variable, is normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "7-Chi-square test\n",
    "A chi-square test is used when you want to see if there is a relationship between two categorical variables.  In SPSS, the chisq option is used on the statistics subcommand of the crosstabs command to obtain the test statistic and its associated p-value.  Using the hsb2 data file, let’s see if there is a relationship between the type of school attended (schtyp) and students’ gender (female).  Remember that the chi-square test assumes that the expected value for each cell is five or higher. \n",
    "\n",
    "8-Fisher’s exact test\n",
    "The Fisher’s exact test is used when you want to conduct a chi-square test but one or more of your cells has an expected frequency of five or less.  Remember that the chi-square test assumes that each cell has an expected frequency of five or more, but the Fisher’s exact test has no such assumption and can be used regardless of how small the expected frequency is. In SPSS unless you have the SPSS Exact Test Module, you can only perform a Fisher’s exact test on a 2×2 table, and these results are presented by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "9-One-way ANOVA\n",
    "A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) is used when you have a categorical independent variable (with two or more categories) and a normally distributed interval dependent variable and you wish to test for differences in the means of the dependent variable broken down by the levels of the independent variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "10-absKruskal Wallis test\n",
    "The Kruskal Wallis test is used when you have one independent variable with two or more levels and an ordinal dependent variable. In other words, it is the non-parametric version of ANOVA and a generalized form of the Mann-Whitney test method since it permits two or more groups.  \n",
    "\n",
    "11-Paired t-test\n",
    "A paired (samples) t-test is used when you have two related observations (i.e., two observations per subject) and you want to see if the means on these two normally distributed interval variables differ from one another.\n",

    "12-Wilcoxon signed rank sum test\n",
    "The Wilcoxon signed rank sum test is the non-parametric version of a paired samples t-test.

    "\n",
    "13-McNemar test\n",
    "You would perform McNemar’s test if you were interested in the marginal frequencies of two binary outcomes. These binary outcomes may be the same outcome variable on matched pairs (like a case-control study) or two outcome variables from a single group.  Continuing with the hsb2 dataset used in several above examples, let us create two binary outcomes in our dataset: himath and hiread. These outcomes can be considered in a two-way contingency table.  The null hypothesis is that the proportion of students in the himath group is the same as the proportion of students in hiread group (i.e., that the contingency table is symmetric).\n",
    "    \n",
    "14-One-way repeated measures ANOVA\n",
    "You would perform a one-way repeated measures analysis of variance if you had one categorical independent variable and a normally distributed interval dependent variable that was repeated at least twice for each subject.  This is the equivalent of the paired samples t-test, but allows for two or more levels of the categorical variable. This tests whether the mean of the dependent variable differs by the categorical variable.  We have an example data set called rb4wide, which is used in Kirk’s book Experimental Design.  In this data set, y is the dependent variable, a is the repeated measure and s is the variable that indicates the subject number.\n",

    "1-Problem:\n",
    "Jane has just begun her new job as on the sales force of a very competitive company. In a sample of 16 sales calls it was found that she closed the contract for an average value of 108 dollars with a standard deviation of 12 dollars. Test at 5% significance that the population mean is at least 100 dollars against the alternative that it is less than 100 dollars. Company policy requires that new members of the sales force must exceed an average of $100 per contract during the trial employment period. Can we conclude that Jane has met this requirement at the significance level of 95%?\n",
    "Solution :\n",
    "H0: µ ≤ 100\n",
    "Ha: µ > 100\n",
    "The null and alternative hypothesis are for the parameter µ because the number of dollars of the contracts is a continuous random variable. Also, this is a one-tailed test because the company has only an interested if the number of dollars per contact is below a particular number not \"too high\" a number. This can be thought of as making a claim that the requirement is being met and thus the claim is in the alternative hypothesis.\n",
    "Test statistic: tc=x¯−µ0sn=108−100(1216)=2.67\n",
    "Critical value: ta=1.753 with n-1 degrees of freedom= 15\n",
    "The test statistic is a Student's t because the sample size is below 30; therefore, we cannot use the normal distribution. Comparing the calculated value of the test statistic and the critical value of t (ta) at a 5% significance level, we see that the calculated value is in the tail of the distribution. Thus, we conclude that 108 dollars per contract is significantly larger than the hypothesized value of 100 and thus we cannot accept the null hypothesis. There is evidence that supports Jane's performance meets company standards.\n",

    "2-Problem :\n",
    "A manufacturer of salad dressings uses machines to dispense liquid ingredients into bottles that move along a filling line. The machine that dispenses salad dressings is working properly when 8 ounces are dispensed. Suppose that the average amount dispensed in a particular sample of 35 bottles is 7.91 ounces with a variance of 0.03 ounces squared, s 2. Is there evidence that the machine should be stopped and production wait for repairs? The lost production from a shutdown is potentially so great that management feels that the level of significance in the analysis should be 99%.\n",
    "Again we will follow the steps in our analysis of this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution :\n",
    "STEP 1: Set the Null and Alternative Hypothesis. The random variable is the quantity of fluid placed in the bottles. This is a continuous random variable and the parameter we are interested in is the mean. Our hypothesis therefore is about the mean. In this case we are concerned that the machine is not filling properly. From what we are told it does not matter if the machine is over-filling or under-filling, both seem to be an equally bad error. This tells us that this is a two-tailed test: if the machine is malfunctioning it will be shutdown regardless if it is from over-filling or under-filling. The null and alternative hypotheses are thus:\n",
    "\n",
    "H 0 : μ = 8\n",
    "H a : μ ≠ 8\n",
    "STEP 2: Decide the level of significance and draw the graph showing the critical value.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem has already set the level of significance at 99%. The decision seems an appropriate one and shows the thought process when setting the significance level. Management wants to be very certain, as certain as probability will allow, that they are not shutting down a machine that is not in need of repair. To draw the distribution and the critical value, we need to know which distribution to use. Because this is a continuous random variable and we are interested in the mean, and the sample size is greater than 30, the appropriate distribution is the normal distribution and the relevant critical value is 2.575 from the normal table or the t-table at 0.005 column and infinite degrees of freedom. We draw the graph and mark these points.\n",
    "STEP 3: Calculate sample parameters and the test statistic. The sample parameters are provided, the sample mean is 7.91 and the sample variance is .03 and the sample size is 35. We need to note that the sample variance was provided not the sample standard deviation, which is what we need for the formula. Remembering that the standard deviation is simply the square root of the variance, we therefore know the sample standard deviation, s, is 0.173. With this information we calculate the test statistic as -3.07, and mark it on the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Z c = x¯ - μ 0 s n = 7.91 - 8 .173 35 =-3.07\n",
    "STEP 4: Compare test statistic and the critical values Now we compare the test statistic and the critical value by placing the test statistic on the graph. We see that the test statistic is in the tail, decidedly greater than the critical value of 2.575. We note that even the very small difference between the hypothesized value and the sample value is still a large number of standard deviations. The sample mean is only 0.08 ounces different from the required level of 8 ounces, but it is 3 plus standard deviations away and thus we cannot accept the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "STEP 5: Reach a Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Three standard deviations of a test statistic will guarantee that the test will fail. The probability that anything is within three standard deviations is almost zero. Actually it is 0.0026 on the normal distribution, which is certainly almost zero in a practical sense. Our formal conclusion would be “ At a 99% level of significance we cannot accept the hypothesis that the sample mean came from a distribution with a mean of 8 ounces” Or less formally, and getting to the point, “At a 99% level of significance we conclude that the machine is under filling the bottles and is in need of repair”.\n",

    "Is there convincing evidence that the average conductivity of this type of glass is greater than one? Use a significance level of 0.05.\n",

    "Let’s follow a four-step process to answer this statistical question.\n",
    "\n",
    "State the Question: We need to determine if, at a 0.05 significance level, the average conductivity of the selected glass is greater than one. Our hypotheses will be\n",
    "H0: μ ≤ 1\n",
    "Ha: μ > 1\n",
    "Plan: We are testing a sample mean without a known population standard deviation with less than 30 observations. Therefore, we need to use a Student's-t distribution. Assume the underlying population is normal.\n",

    "4-Problem\n",
    "In a study of 420,019 cell phone users, 172 of the subjects developed brain cancer. Test the claim that cell phone users developed brain cancer at a greater rate than that for non-cell phone users (the rate of brain cancer for non-cell phone users is 0.0340%). Since this is a critical issue, use a 0.005 significance level. Explain why the significance level should be so low in terms of a Type I error.\n",
    "Solution 1\n",
    "We need to conduct a hypothesis test on the claimed cancer rate. Our hypotheses will be\n",
    "H0: p ≤ 0.00034\n",
    "Ha: p > 0.00034\n",
    "If we commit a Type I error, we are essentially accepting a false claim. Since the claim describes cancer-causing environments, we want to minimize the chances of incorrectly identifying causes of cancer.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be testing a sample proportion with x = 172 and n = 420,019. The sample is sufficiently large because we have np' = 420,019(0.00034) = 142.8, nq' = 420,019(0.99966) = 419,876.2, two independent outcomes, and a fixed probability of success p' = 0.00034.

    "She then performs a hypothesis test using the following hypotheses:\n",

    "H0: μ = 20 inches (the fertilizer will have no effect on the mean plant growth)\n",
    "HA: μ > 20 inches (the fertilizer will cause mean plant growth to increase)\n",
